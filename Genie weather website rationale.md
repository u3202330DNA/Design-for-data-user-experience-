# Genie weather app
_Name of the app, **catchy!** related to something random that can happen in the weather as it is always changing for as much accuracy we want to have, weather will always impact anything we do in daily activities_

## Ask for magic feature
**Not available now :(** _But this feature could give the user an engagement feature that would allow them to interact with a range of daily feelings related to the weather forecast to cheer up the user's world, it can even give you options on what to wear depending on the forecast_

### Ideas
A few examples of actual application for implementation

1. Carrot weather app
2. Tycho weather app
3. Weather app
4. Weatherzone

>The above applications were choosen as an inspiration on what I am looking for on the web page, as they are relating personality and a unique touch to the usability and interaction of the interface. As an example Carrot weather app has an "easter hunt" search for places and gives hints when getting close, tycho creates a playlist for you depending on the weather in spotify, or itunes. Weather app gives recommendation for activities, such as outdoor sports, and Weather zone gives a smooth presentation displaying photos from users as weather changes, however, more improvements are to be made in the current web page.

| Weather website comparison |Interaction |
| ----- |------- |
|[Weather underground](https://www.wunderground.com) | Not appealing to eye and hard to read|
| [SAT24CC](https://sat24.cc)  | Clothing suggestion and weather by country |
| [Ventusky](https://www.ventusky.com)  | Appealing to read straight forward radar |

The above websites gave me an idea for the structure of my application, what would I like to see, how would I understand better all the information, what got me confussed while reading the other websites and how they worked.

In my Weather app users can easily read seven day weather forecast in a table with time and date with geo location in the main page. Easy to locate information and identify additional information of interest.

The colours of the websites were chosen as gradient to give an easy focus relating sunrise and sunset colours of the day with a subtle touch of brown to red color un the text. Bold font to create a solid look in the table.

The code displays the geolocation of the user, the suburb, city and postcode for accuracy purposes.

### Further opportunity for development

Based in one of my hobbies which is riding motorcycle, further implementations base in other weather apps are:

- live navigation
- riders data
- wind and precepitation (already implemented)
- roads recommended for type of bikes

#### Conclusion 
This assignment gave me a major overview to understand how to code using HTML/JS/ and how Jquery plays a big part in the interaction of websites. Using CSS to make the website more appealing was great as I was able to play with the format. What I found particularly challenging was the addition to icons to my code which unfortunaately I was ruining upon implementation of icons.
